README

This program will run the expanded version of Robbins and Robbins exercise 3.9.
Makefile will compile both testsim.c and proc_fan.c, however if a differently
testsim-style file is used proc_fan will allow it.

Usage for proc_fan: ./proc_fan -n val
where val is the number of concurrent processes allowed.

Usage for testsim: ./testsim r w
where r is the number of repeats a process will undergo
and w is the wait time in seconds between repeats.

In any testing data file (here testing.data is used), the executable therein
MUST be prefixed by ./ (i.e. ./testsim), as I have not yet found a foolproof
way around it.

The program will output the status of the processes, notably the repeats and
wait times from testsim. proc_fan will alert on process creation and death.

git was used as version control; my github is github.com/DaTino for remote
git usage.

Please be gentle and let me know how I can improve for the upcoming projects.

Qapla'!
